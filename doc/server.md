# Server/API

### Overview

```
Interactive Fiction Engine includes a python server for interacting between frontend and engine.c
The python server also provides some functions for admin/user to edit/modify files generated by Interactive Fiction Engine.
Before running the server, make sure you have typed command "make" in order to generate ./engine and ./api
You may notice that the server is actually boot/started by ./engine or ./api,
which means the python server normally will not be started by itself.
```

### Commands for admin

```shell
./api del_saves         // deletes all save file (including save dir)
./api start_server [folder_of_your_game/script]  // equals to ./engine [folder-name] (ex. ./engine ./example-game/)
```

```
You may also type command which same format from the server interacting to ./api to inspect/check
the function is exactly ruuning as your imagination or not.

However, normally those command sent from the server usually just return a file_path/file_name,
so the server can easily return the file.

Therefore, I recommend developers/users inspect the ./output folder, which contains
all the output file generated by your script.yaml and assets

All the server do is receiving "GET" from frontend and sending command to ./api.c
and ./api.c will return what frontend should display next.
