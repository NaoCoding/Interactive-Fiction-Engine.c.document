# Server/API

### Overview

```
Interactive Fiction Engine includes a python server for interacting between frontend and engine.c
The python server also provides some functions for admin/user to edit/modify files generated by Interactive Fiction Engine.
Before running the server, make sure you have typed command "make" in order to generate ./engine and ./api
You may notice that the server is actually boot/started by ./engine or ./api,
which means the python server normally will not start itself.
```

### Commands for admin

```shell
./api del_saves         // deletes all save file (including save dir)
./api start_server [folder_of_your_game/script]  // equals to ./engine [folder-name] (ex. ./engine ./example-game/)
```
